summary: Duplicity offers encrypted bandwidth-efficient backup
maintainer: Ryan Farrell <Ryan.Farrell@ryancision7250>
description: |
  Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes
  and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity
  uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only
  record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup.
  Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives,
  they will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server.
